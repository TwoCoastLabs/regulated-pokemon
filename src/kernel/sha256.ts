/**
 * SHA-256, written out, so a digest is a pure function of code in this
 * repository rather than of the runtime it happens to execute on.
 *
 * The kernel's digests began life on `node:crypto`, which a browser does not
 * have — and the sabotage page runs the kernel in a browser, on purpose, so a
 * visitor triggers the same mutation CI runs. The platform alternative,
 * WebCrypto, is asynchronous, and a verdict that awaited its own evidence
 * would push `async` through every enforcement path for the sake of a hash.
 * So the function is vendored, the same decision the formatters made about
 * `Intl`: fifty lines of FIPS 180-4, identical everywhere, replayable
 * anywhere (IA-10). A test cross-checks it against `node:crypto` so the two
 * can never quietly disagree.
